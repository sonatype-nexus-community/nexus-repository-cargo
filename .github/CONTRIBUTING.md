## How to be a contributor to this project

### Are you submitting a pull request?

* Use [our codestyle](https://github.com/sonatype/codestyle). If we get a PR that doesn't match it, there will be much shaming throughout the land. If you use an editor besides Eclipse or IntelliJ, adapt the codestyle and submit a PR there :)
* Fill out a CLA for us, you should get a request for this on your PR if you have not filled it out yet.
* Make sure to fill out an issue for your PR, so that we have traceability as to what you are trying to fix,versus how you fixed it.
* Try to fix one thing per pull request! Many people work on this code, so the more focused your changes are, the less of a headache other people will have when they merge their work in.
* Make sure to add yourself or your organization to CONTRIBUTORS.md as a part of your PR, if you are new to the project!
* If you're stuck, ask our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers)! There are a number of experienced programmers who are happy to help with learning and troubleshooting.
